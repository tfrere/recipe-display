TITLE:
Campari and Grapefruit Sorbet

NOTES:
---This is so refreshing and party-like that it can be served at pretty much any point during a meal. Before you start eating, for example, with a splash of Prosecco on top; as a palate-cleanser between courses; or for dessert in frosted Martini glasses with one of the Cats’ Tongues alongside and possibly also a naughty extra glug of Campari. Don’t be tempted to use pale yellow grapefruit here: you really want the ruby red variety, as it provides both the shock of colour and the sweetness you want to bring to the party. Once you’ve made the sorbet, you’re all set to make the Chocolate-coated Ruby Red Grapefruit Peel, if you like, as you’ll have the peel all ready to go. If you don’t want to do this straight away, collect the peel in a zip-lock bag and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days.

SPECIAL EQUIPMENT:
- Ice cream maker
- Food processor or blender
- Fine-mesh sieve
- Small saucepan
- Ice bath or fridge
- Container with lid
- Cling film

INGREDIENTS:
- 2-5 grapefruits (ruby red variety)
- 500ml fresh ruby red grapefruit juice
- 60ml lemon juice
- 100ml orange juice
- 200g caster sugar
- 80ml Campari

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. If you are going to make the Chocolate-coated Ruby Red Grapefruit Peel, follow the slicing instructions in that recipe, retaining the flesh for use here, and storing the peel until ready to use. Otherwise, cut each grapefruit in half and remove the flesh.
2. Make sure there are no pips in the flesh, then place it in a blender or food processor and blend until the grapefruit is crushed.
3. Strain it into a bowl through a fine-mesh sieve: you need 500ml of juice, so feel free to drink any excess (or make a cocktail with it).
4. Add the lemon and orange juice to the grapefruit juice and mix together.
5. Pour 250ml of this into a small saucepan with the sugar, and set the remaining juice aside.
6. Heat the pan over a low heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved, then set aside for **10min** to cool.
7. Pour this into the remaining juice, add the Campari, and chill completely by setting it over an ice bath or placing it in the fridge.
8. Once chilled, transfer to an ice cream maker and churn until soft waves form.
9. Transfer the sorbet to a container, cover with cling film – so that the cling film is actually touching the surface of the sorbet, to prevent ice particles forming – and seal the container.
10. Freeze until firm enough to scoop into a glass, and serve.
