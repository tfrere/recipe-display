Alright, I'm going to process this recipe content. First, I need to validate if it's a valid recipe. The content has a title, ingredients, and instructions, so it looks good.

Next, I'll extract the notes. The description says it's a rich and moist cake serving 8, so that's a note. There's no other text before ingredients, so that's all for notes.

Metadata: The recipe doesn't mention nationality, author, or book, so those will be empty. Quality score is based on completeness, so I'll give it 85.

The image URL is provided, so I'll include that. 

For special equipment, the instructions mention a greased cake tin and a wire rack. Since these are non-standard, I'll list them.

Ingredients are straightforward. I'll list each with their quantities as given.

Instructions are already numbered, but I need to check the time formatting. The baking time is 30 minutes, which is correct as "30min". I'll make sure to format it properly.

I'll structure everything according to the specified format, ensuring each section is clear and correctly labeled. No sub-recipes here, so the instructions are simple.

Finally, I'll double-check that all critical points are addressed, like keeping quantities exact and not adding any new info. Everything looks in order, so I'll present the cleaned recipe.
