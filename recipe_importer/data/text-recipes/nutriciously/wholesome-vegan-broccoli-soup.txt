Make the soup
Saut√©e the onion and garlic in a large pot with 2-3 tablespoons vegetable broth until fragrant.

Add the celery and potatoes to the pot, and cook for 2-3 minutes over medium heat. 

Add the broccoli florets, almond milk, vegetable broth, and soy sauce to the pot, stir to combine, and bring to a boil over medium heat.

Turn the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the spinach, mix, and simmer for 5 more minutes.

Add the nutritional yeast, almond butter, and nutmeg to the pot, and use an immersion blender to blend until you get the desired consistency (we kept it chunky and rustic).

Add salt and nutritional yeast to taste.

Divide into serving bowls, garnish with toasted seeds of choice, fresh aromatic herbs, and roasted chickpeas, and serve warm.
