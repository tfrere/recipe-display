What is chili sin carne?
Chili sin carne means chili without meat and uses plant-based protein like beans, cooked quinoa, mock meats or TVP instead of meat. You can flavor it the same way as traditional chili con carne and get a very similar result that‚Äôs vegan-friendly and rich in fiber!

Why you‚Äôll love it
True win with any non-vegans
Budget-friendly & so easy to make
Savory, comforting & hearty
Protein-rich and fiber-rich
Features hidden veggies
Perfect for meal prep & easy to customize
There are so many reasons for making this hearty chili sin carne one of your must-have weekly meals!

Since it‚Äôs made mostly from pantry staples plus a handful of veggies from your fridge or freezer, there‚Äôs pretty much no instance in which you couldn‚Äôt make it.

Ingredients needed
Zucchini ‚Äì subtle texture that‚Äôll soak up all of the delicious spicy flavors
Carrot ‚Äì giving the chili a nice bite and additional color
Bell pepper ‚Äì high in vitamin C and adding some Mexican flavor
Kidney beans ‚Äì recommended but can be swapped for black beans
Chickpeas ‚Äì more plant-based protein, color, texture and yumminess
Corn ‚Äì not sure if it‚Äôs a classic chili ingredient but blends in beautifully
Diced tomatoes ‚Äì almost any canned tomato product can be used to bind everything together nicely
This one-pot chili sin carne doesn‚Äôt require many kitchen tools, either! A can opener, chopping board, knife, measuring equipment and a large pot is everything you need.

How to make vegan chili sin carne 
Saut√© onion and garlic in a large pot over medium heat in a splash of vegetable broth or olive oil.
Add the chopped veggies and saut√© for 5 more minutes.
Add the remaining ingredients: vegetable broth, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, corn, kidney beans, chickpeas, soy sauce, paprika, cumin and chili powder.
Stir well to combine, then let your chili simmer for 15 minutes.
Once it has thickened, remove it from the stove.
Adjust to taste preferences by adding more chili or salt, then serve warm!

Tips & replacements
Here are some great ideas to modify this recipe to your needs!

Veggies: feel free to omit any veggies or replace them with mushrooms, sweet potatoes, winter squash or celery. You can leave out the veggies entirely, too!
Beans: black beans, pinto beans and white beans can be used instead of kidney beans and chickpeas. We also like to make this recipe with red lentils, textured vegetable protein, crushed walnuts or crumbled tofu!
Spices: try adding some cocoa powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper and a spritz of maple syrup!
Make this recipe gluten-free by using tamari instead of soy sauce.

Be sure to chop the veggies really finely so that they are well hidden amongst all those beans!

Adjust the chili powder to your preferred level of hotness.

Instructions
Heat up a large non-stick pot over medium-high heat. Dry saut√© the garlic and onion until slightly soft. Use a splash of olive oil if wanted to make the chili richer!
Add half a cup of the vegetable broth, the bell pepper, carrot, and zucchini. Saut√© for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Now, add all remaining ingredients (the rest of the vegetable broth, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, corn, kidney beans, chickpeas, soy sauce, paprika, cumin, and cayenne). Stir well, then let the mixture simmer, uncovered, for another 15 minutes until it has thickened.
Add more cayenne and salt to taste, then serve warm on its own or with rice, tortillas, baked potatoes, or cornbread. Enjoy!
Notes
You can use any veggies you like in place of the zucchini, carrot, and bell peppers. The overall amount can be increased or decreased to your preference ‚Äì just adjust the liquid accordingly.
The kidney beans and chickpeas can be swapped for any other beans like black beans or white beans.
If you‚Äôre looking for a more ‚Äúmeaty‚Äù experience and extra chewiness, you can add some textured vegetable protein to the bean chili.
Adjust hotness through the amount of chili, and feel free to experiment with smoked paprika or a hint of cocoa powder.

Yes, we meant 1/2 tsp. Thanks for the tip and sorry for the confusion ‚Äì I just went ahead and corrected it. Hope you like the recipe and of course you can tweak the amount of cayenne depending on how spicy you like it (we like it hot & spicy!). :)

Hi guys! The photos are speaking themself; you‚Äôre cozier just looking at them. This recipe is ideal for warming inside when getting colder outside. For the recipe, do you use fresh, canned or frozen corn? Thanks so much!

In the nutrition information for this recipe, the saturated fat is listed as 11g, which is half the recommended daily value. What ingredient(s) contribute that much fat? I‚Äôm baffled ‚Äî or maybe just ignorant.

Hi Kathe,
sorry the nutrition information isn‚Äôt super easy to read! It says ‚Äútotal fat: 11g; saturated fat: 2g; trans fat: 0‚Äù This seems to be more accurate, right? The saturated fat is probably from the avocado mostly.
Hope this helps!
Best wishes

I LOVE this chili. When i made it the first time, it was too spicy for me, but after the 3 or 4th bowl, i began to LOVE it!!!! I use fresh corn off the cob when available, the tiny can of tomato paste, and whole cans of each bean to make it easier and not waste the remainder of the cans. I dice up most of the veggies, but like to keep the carrots in like nickel sized slices to have some larger texture in there. I make it all using my dutch oven and it smells amazing while cooking!!! I get quite a few servings and since i‚Äôm the only one in my family that eats it, i freeze half. I use the first batch for lunch for 2 or 3 days, and then a week or so later, defrost the rest and finish that week for lunch. i love that i have a filling and healthy lunch quick and easy! Thanks so much for this great recipe. I‚Äôll be looking around your site to see if there are any other make ahead healthy dishes i can use for lunch!!!

Can you recommend cooking instructions for an instapot, please? Also, when do you suggest adding the TVP? Thanks! Love this recipe.

Hi Sarah, add the TVP along with the beans to the pot. It‚Äôll have time to soften and soak up all flavors! Cook it in an Instant Pot by saut√©ing the veggies first (in the IP), then adding the rest of the ingredients and cooking for around 8 minutes. It‚Äôs been a while since I made this chili in an IP, so I hope I remember the time correctly.

4 starsIndeed the best vegan chili! It‚Äôs really delicious. I used Fava beans instead of Kidney beans and Cousa Squash instead of the Zucchini. Next time i‚Äôm making this I‚Äôll add not as much chili and paprika tho, it was definitely too hot for my personal taste.
