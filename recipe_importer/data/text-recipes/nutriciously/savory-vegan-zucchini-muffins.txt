How to make vegan savory zucchini muffins
Preheat the oven to 345 ¬∞F (175 ¬∞C). 

Combine the whole grain flour, walnuts, baking powder, garlic, flax, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and nutritional yeast in a large bowl.

Squeeze water from the shredded zucchini and carrot, then combine them with the scallions, soy milk, apple cider vinegar, and water in a large bowl.

Pour wet ingredients over the flour mixture.

Fold everything to get a thick batter. Add more soy milk if too dry and more grain flour if it is too wet. The consistency should be thicker than pancake batter but thinner than cookie dough batter.

Divide the mixture into muffin tins and bake for 40 minutes until golden. Remove from the oven and cool completely on the rack before serving.

Storage & reheating
Store your muffins, once cooled, in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. 

You can also store them in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 5 days. However, the fridge will alter the taste and texture, so keep that in mind. 

For the freezer, wrap muffins individually in a freezer-safe container and store for 2-3 months. Let them defrost at room temperature and reheat in the microwave or oven.

Serving suggestions
Enjoy these savory vegan zucchini muffins as-is for a tasty snack or breakfast!

We also love adding a pat of vegan butter or almond butter on top and heating it in the microwave. When the butter sinks into the muffin, it‚Äôs even more rich and savory!

You can also pair them with a bigger meal, such as tofu scramble or crepes, and serve them for brunch! 

These muffins would taste even more delicious while sipping on a warm, spiced drink like a golden milk latte.

FAQs & tips
How do I shred the zucchini and carrot?
There are a couple of ways! First, we recommended a box or cheese grater. It‚Äôs super simple and gets the right size.

You can also use a spiralizer and then quickly pulse the spirals in a food processor to break up the pieces. Additionally, you can find pre-shredded carrots at the stores!

My batter is super dry/too watery!
Have no fear! If your batter is too dry, add a little non-dairy milk at a time and mix. If it‚Äôs too watery, add a few tablespoons of flour at a time until it‚Äôs the right consistency. 

This batter consistency can vary for everyone because your veggie shreds may contain more or less water than what we tested. Simply make slow adjustments until the batter is right (thicker than pancake batter, thinner than cookie dough).

Can I substitute the whole grain flour?
We haven‚Äôt tested this recipe with other flour, so we recommended only using whole grain flour! The reason why it‚Äôs tricky to substitute is because whole grain flour results in a denser texture and cooks differently.

If you absolutely had to use a different flour, substitute it by weight instead of measuring cups.
